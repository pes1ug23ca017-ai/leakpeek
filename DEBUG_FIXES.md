# LeakPeek Debug Fixes

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Logo Not Working
- **Problem**: Missing `assets/logo.png` and `assets/google_logo.png` files
- **Solution**: 
  - Replaced Image.asset with Container + Icon widgets for immediate functionality
  - Created assets directory and added logo.svg as fallback
  - Updated pubspec.yaml to include assets folder

### 2. Windows Developer Mode Issue
- **Problem**: Flutter requires symlink support for plugins
- **Solution**: 
  - App now works on web platform (Chrome/Edge) without Developer Mode
  - Use `flutter run -d chrome` to test the app
  - Desktop version will work once Developer Mode is enabled

### 3. Deprecated API Usage
- **Problem**: `onBackground` is deprecated in Material 3
- **Solution**: Replaced with `onSurface` in all screen files

## How to Run:

### Web (Recommended for now):
```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

### Desktop (After enabling Developer Mode):
```bash
flutter run -d windows
```

## Assets Status:
- ✅ Logo: Now uses Flutter Icon widget (immediate fix)
- ✅ Google Logo: Now uses Flutter Icon widget (immediate fix)
- ✅ Assets directory: Created and configured
- ✅ SVG logo: Added as fallback

## Next Steps:
1. Test the app on web platform
2. Enable Windows Developer Mode for desktop development
3. Add custom logo images to assets/ folder if desired
